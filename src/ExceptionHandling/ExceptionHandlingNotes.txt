Q.1 WHAT IS EXCEPTION  IN JAVA ?
====>
     An exception is an unexpected event or error that occurs during a program's execution, disrupting its normal flow.
     It represents a "special case" or error condition—such as dividing by zero or accessing missing files—that breaks
     the standard rules of execution, which can be caught and handled to prevent crashes

Q2. Why we get Exception in java ?
====>
    🔴 Reasons for Exception in Java
    1️⃣ Invalid User Input

    When the user provides incorrect or unexpected input.
    Example:
    int a = Integer.parseInt("abc"); // NumberFormatException

    2️⃣ Division by Zero
    Dividing a number by zero.
    Example:
    int a = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException

    3️⃣ Accessing Invalid Array Index
    Trying to access an index outside the array size.
    Example:
    int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(arr[5]); // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

    4️⃣ Using a Null Reference
    Calling a method or accessing a variable on a null object.
    Example:
    String s = null;
    System.out.println(s.length()); // NullPointerException

    5️⃣ File or Resource Not Found
    Trying to access a file that does not exist.
    Example:
    FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("data.txt");
    // FileNotFoundException

    6️⃣ Type Casting Error
    Casting an object to an incompatible type.
    Example:
    Object obj = "Java";
    Integer i = (Integer) obj; // ClassCastException

    7️⃣ Database or Network Issues
    Problems while connecting to a database or network.
    Examples:
    SQLException, IOException

    8️⃣ Memory Issues
    When JVM runs out of memory.
    Example:
    OutOfMemoryError

    9️⃣ Infinite Recursion
    Too many recursive method calls.
    Example:
    StackOverflowError

    🔟 Programming / Logical Errors
    Wrong conditions
    Infinite loops

    Not closing resources properly

    📌 Types of Exceptions
    Type	    Description 	            Examples
    Checked     Exception	                Checked at compile time	IOException, SQLException
    Unchecked   Exception	                Occur at runtime	NullPointerException, ArithmeticException
    Error	    Serious system problems	    OutOfMemoryError

    Q.Exception vs Throwable

    In Java, both Error and Exception are subclasses of the Throwable class, but they represent different types of problems
     and are handled differently.
    Exceptions are generally recoverable problems that occur due to issues in the application code,
            such as invalid user input or network failures, and should be handled programmatically.
    Errors are serious, unrecoverable problems that occur outside the control of the application, usually within the
            Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or the system environment, and most applications should not try to catch them.

    Key Differences: Error vs. Exception
    Aspect 	            Error (java.lang.Error)	                     Exception (java.lang.Exception)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Nature	            Serious, system-level issues                 Application-level issues (e.g., bad input, file not found,
                        (e.g., resource depletion, JVM crash).	     programming logic errors).
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Recoverability	    Generally not recoverable; typically         Recoverable; can be caught and handled using try-catch
                        leads to abnormal program termination.	     blocks to allow the program to continue running.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Handling	        Not meant to be caught or                    Designed to be caught and handled to prevent program crashes.
                        handled by application code.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Type	            Always unchecked (not checked at             Can be checked (compile-time, must be handled)
                        compile time).                                or unchecked (runtime, optional handling).
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Examples	        OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError,         IOException, SQLException, NullPointerException,
                        VirtualMachineError.                                                ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difference Between Error and Exception in Java
    Error	                                                        Exception
    An error cannot be handled at runtime.	                        An exception can be handled at runtime
    An error can occur both at compile time                         Although all the Exceptions occur at runtime.
    and during runtime.                                             But checked Exceptions can be detected at compile time.
    There are 3 types of Errors: Syntax Error,                      There are 2 types of Exceptions: Checked Exceptions and Unchecked Exceptions
     Runtime Error and Logical Error
    An error has the capacity to terminate your program             An exception has the capacity to distract the normal flow of the program
    and maybe your system as well.                                  and change its direction to somewhere else when an exceptional case has occurred.

    An Error is such an event that no one can control               An Exception can be guessed, handled, and utilized in order
    or guess when it is going to happen.	                        to change the original flow of the program.

    An Error can be thought of as an explosion that happens         An Exception can be thought of as a last line of defense to prevent errors.
    when there is no defense or checks against a particular
     failure condition.

    Key Distinctions
    Error indicates a problem that is outside the scope of the application code's control, such as running out of memory
        or a fundamental issue with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Trying to catch and handle these generally does not
        make sense because the program is in an unstable state and should usually be allowed to terminate.
    Exception is intended for conditions that a reasonable application might want to anticipate and handle programmatically.
        For example, if a program tries to open a file that doesn't exist, a FileNotFoundException is thrown,
        which the programmer can catch and manage gracefully (e.g., by prompting the user for a new file path).
    =========================================================================================================================
    Checked vs. Unchecked Exceptions: All errors are unchecked. Exceptions, however, are further divided:
    Checked exceptions (e.g., IOException) must be handled explicitly in the code (using try-catch or a throws clause) for
        the program to compile.
    Unchecked exceptions (e.g., RuntimeException subclasses like NullPointerException or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) are
        typically the result of programming errors and do not need to be explicitly handled by the compiler,
         although they can be caught.

    Array   => Collection framework
    Thread  => Executor framework

   File  => Apache POI, Itext
   Q1. what is apache poi ?
     Apache POI (Poor Obfuscation Implementation) is an open-source Java library used to create, read, modify,
     and manipulate Microsoft Office documents—including Excel (.xls, .xlsx), Word (.doc, .docx), and PowerPoint
      (.ppt, .pptx)—programmatically without requiring Microsoft Office installed. It is widely used in
      Selenium automation for data-driven testing and handling file conversions,
      supporting both User Model (DOM-style) and Event Model (low-memory) APIs.

   Q2. What is Itext ?
        iText is a widely used software development kit (SDK) and library for creating, manipulating,
        and editing PDF documents in Java and .NET (C#) applications. It allows developers to automate the generation
        of high-volume, data-driven documents such as invoices, statements, and boarding passes

   Q3. Compile time or Checked exception
   ==> when compiler forces developer to handle the exceptions at compile time (without handling those exceptions your
        code will not compile ) so those exceptions are called Compile time or checked exception

   Q4. What should go in try block => the code which might cause an exception should go in try block;
       What should go in catch block =>

   finally block ==> whether exception occurs or not, code in finally block will always gets executed


   Q.5 what is exception propagation in java
        Exception propagation in Java is the mechanism by which an exception is passed up the method call stack from
        the method where it occurred to its calling methods, until it is caught and handled by an appropriate try-catch block
        or reaches the top of the stack and terminates the program.
