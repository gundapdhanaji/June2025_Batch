Map interface
    => HashMap
    => LinkedHashMap
    => TreeMap


    map interface methods ?
    put();
    remove();

    If two objects are equal according to the equals method, they must have the same hashcode
    If two objects have the same hash code, they might be  equal according to equals method,

    what is hashing technique ?
    ==> HashMap internally working on hashing technique
    when we apply hashCode() method on object, it gives us some unique int value, this is called hashing.


    Map does not allow duplicate keys but we can insert multiple duplicate values
    Map allows single null key but we can insert multiple null values
    Map does not maintain insertion order
    If we insert duplicate keys in Map, It will replace older value with New Value

    I have different keys but both are returning same hashCode value

    hashcode and memory address are they same or different ?
   => both are different
        hashcode is the unique identifier for each object it is not for your memory address

    Why java map gives bucket index 0 when we add null key ?
    ==> when we add null key by default it takes 0 index because of we
