what is static ?
--> static is a keyword

whatever static it belongs to whole class i.e all Objects
of that class will get same value for static variable

for instance variable, each instance or object will get a separate copy
of that variable

why we need static in java ?

No need to create an object of the class to access static members/variables
using class name we can access members/variables
